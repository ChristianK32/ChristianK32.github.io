Journal Entry #1

This first entry is going to be about some of the new things I learned this year in web design. First, we learned about the terminal and some of the basic commands that can be used. The terminal is a way to quickly navigate your computer with certain commands. We also learned about github. A website used to share your coding work with others all over the world. Finally, we were introduced to vim. A text editor used to make editing files much easier. So far I have found these new technologies to be very interesting but somewhat confusing. It is hard to remeber some of the commands used for these technologies. Especially because I was out sick for one of the important classes. Some advice I would give to future students is to pay attention in class, make sure that you remember all the commands or write them down somewhere to store, and to ask questions if you need help.
