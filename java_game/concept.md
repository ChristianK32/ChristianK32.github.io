## Game Concept

My game is going to be a basketball clicking game, where you click a basketball to earn money. You earn more money by upgrading your basketball player. The objective is to earn as much money as possible. There is a score and it is the amount of money you have. There is no win or lose for this game, you play until you earn enough money to where you get bored. The player will interact with the game by clicking a basketball on the screen. The MVP will have a clickable basketballa score counter and at least 1 upgrade.
