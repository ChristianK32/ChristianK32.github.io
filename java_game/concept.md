## Game Concept

My game is going to be a basketball clicking game, where you click a basketball to earn points. You earn more points by upgrading your basketball player. The objective is to earn as much points as possible until you are number 1 on the leaderboard. There is a score and it is the amount of points you have. There is no win or lose for this game, you play until you earn enough points to where you get bored. The player will interact with the game by clicking a basketball on the screen. The MVP will have a clickable basketballa score counter and at least 1 upgrade.
