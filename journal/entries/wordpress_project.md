## Reflection

During this project, the business I created was a sports brand.
Specifically focusing on producing and selling squash gear. The websites I
studied for inspiration were [dunlop squash](https://dunlopsports.com/squash/),
[nike](https://www.nike.com/), and [squash gear](https://squashgear.com/). All
these businesses sell squash or sports related apparel and equipment. Dunlop
squash is the biggest squash brand in the world, so I took a lot of inspiration
from their website. I really liked how they included a page for their team of
proffesionals they sponser, leading me to include this page in my website also.
Another aspect of these websites I used in my website, is the layout of their
pages. All these websites had similar pages.  My expierience with Wordpress was
alright. I started off a little lost with how to make my website, but I
eventually figured it out. It was a little difficult to navigate through
Wordpress while constantly getting shut out of certain areas of their website,
due to being on a free plan. However, I did find it to be relatively simple to
work through, but there was some little things that had me irritated. Such as, I
had a hard time changing the layout of my website from the template I was on
without deleting chunks of my website. I found all the different types of blocks
to be helpful. Also, it was much easier to use, because of the simplicity of the
website creation process.
