		<h2>Background</h2>
		Chocolate chip cookies have always held a special place in my family’s heart and kitchen. This recipe has been passed down through generations. I chose this recipe not only for its deliciously gooey texture and rich chocolate flavor but also for the memories it evokes.

Baking these cookies is more than just a culinary activity; it’s a cherished tradition that brings us closer, reminding us of family gatherings, celebrations, and the simple joy of sharing homemade treats. I hope this recipe brings you as much joy and connection as it has brought to our family over the years

	<h3>Some tips and tricks for the recipe</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Don't Overmix</strong>, when combining the wet and dry ingredients, mix just until combined.</li>
		
	<li><strong>Chill the dough</strong>, chilling the dough helps produce a stronger flavor and prevents the cookies from spreading too much while baking, leading to chewier and delicious cookies</li>
	
	<li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients</strong>, make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature before mixing. This helps creates a smoother batter.</li>
</ul>
