The difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is the asymmetric uses two keys in the procces making it more secure. Whereas, symmetric uses one key and is not as secure.

First, the sender of the message sends the encrypted message to someone else with their public key. Then, the person who is recieving the message decrypts the message using their private key.

It is impportant to never share your secret key because if someone else has it they can get access into your computer.
